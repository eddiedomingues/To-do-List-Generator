## Please readme if you want to try the app

If you want to use the .PDF and .DOCX export method you will have to be logged in onto a valid account otherwise the server will block you. If you want to try these methods please contact me for access to the accounts. This is done to prevent overuse of the Adobe PDF Cloud services (To save costs).
